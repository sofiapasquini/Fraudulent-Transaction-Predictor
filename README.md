# Fraudulent-Transaction-Predictor

#I use sklearn's LogisticRegression in order to classify a set of credit card transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on a set of 28 features obtained from Partial Component Analysis (PCA).
These credit card transactions were derived from a subset of Europeans in September of 2013; the file containing these data was far too large for uplaod, so please contact me if you require access to it.:)
I explore regression using both only a single feature (the amount of a given transaction) as well as all predictor variables and find (as suspected) that the Amount-only classifier performs worse than that which uses all predictor variables.
